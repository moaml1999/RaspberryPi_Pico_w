 * Control LED on Raspberry Pi Pico using Blynk Platform and CircuitPython

 <p>In this project, we use a Raspberry Pi Pico to control an LED using the Blynk platform and CircuitPython. Blynk is a tool that lets us create custom smartphone apps to control hardware remotely. CircuitPython is a special version of Python that works on small devices like the Raspberry Pi Pico.

To make it work, we connect the LED to the Pi Pico and create a circuit. We then set up a Blynk app on our smartphone and add a button to control the LED. When we press the button in the app, the LED turns on or off.
